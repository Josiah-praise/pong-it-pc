# 🔴 CRITICAL DEBUG TEST

## The Situation

Room count shows **ZERO** when rematch is requested, meaning the room is being destroyed.

We've added extensive logging to find out **HOW** the room is being destroyed.

---

## What to Do

### 1. Restart Backend (should auto-restart)

### 2. Play a Complete Game
- Start unstaked game
- **Play until one player wins naturally** (don't forfeit, don't disconnect)
- Both players should reach GameOver screen

### 3. Look for These Logs

**When game ends, you MUST see:**
```
🎮 ========== GAME OVER ==========
🏆 Room: ABC123, Winner: PlayerName
📊 Game state: { players: ['Player1', 'Player2'], score: [11, 9] }
👥 Winner: Player1, Loser: Player2
```

**Then later:**
```
🏠 Game over for room ABC123 - preserving room: true
```

**If you DON'T see these logs**, the game is ending via a different path!

### 4. Check for Unexpected Events

Look for any of these logs **BEFORE** clicking rematch:
- `🚪 handleLeaveRoom: Player leaving room...`
- `🔌 ========== DISCONNECT ==========`
- `🗑️ handleLeaveRoom: Destroying room...`

If you see ANY of these, it means:
- Players are disconnecting when navigating to GameOver
- Or `leaveRoom` is being called unintentionally

---

## Hypothesis

I suspect that when players navigate to the GameOver screen, their **old game sockets are disconnecting**, which triggers `handleDisconnect()`, which then destroys the room!

The frontend might be creating a **new socket connection** for GameOver and abandoning the old one.

## Test Results We Need

Please share:
1. ✅ Do you see `🎮 ========== GAME OVER ==========` ?
2. ✅ Do you see `🏠 Game over for room... - preserving room: true` ?
3. ✅ Do you see any `🔌 DISCONNECT` logs between game end and rematch request?
4. ✅ Do you see any `🚪 handleLeaveRoom` logs?

This will tell us exactly what's happening!
