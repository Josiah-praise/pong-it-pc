# Staked Game Cancel Fix

## 🐛 The Bug

When Player 2 clicked "Cancel" on the staking modal, the game would end for both players and Player 1 would see "Opponent disconnected" alert.

**Root Cause:** The frontend navigated away immediately, causing a socket disconnect before the backend could distinguish between:
- Intentional leave (canceling staking modal)
- Unintentional disconnect (network issue, closed tab, etc.)

---

## ✅ The Fix

### **Solution: Explicit Leave Event**

Added a new socket event `leaveRoomBeforeStaking` that is emitted BEFORE navigating away, so the backend knows this is an intentional leave.

---

## 🔧 Frontend Changes

### **MultiplayerGame.tsx**

Both "Cancel" buttons now emit `leaveRoomBeforeStaking` before navigating:

```typescript
<button
  onClick={() => {
    setShowPlayer2StakingModal(false);
    setStakingData(null);
    setStakingErrorMessage(null);
    // NEW: Tell backend we're leaving before staking
    if (socketRef.current && stakingData?.roomCode) {
      socketRef.current.emit('leaveRoomBeforeStaking', { roomCode: stakingData.roomCode });
    }
    navigate('/');
  }}
  className="decline-btn"
>
  Cancel
</button>
```

---

## 🔧 Backend Changes

### **1. New Socket Handler** (`multiplayerHandler.js`)

```javascript
socket.on('leaveRoomBeforeStaking', ({ roomCode }) => {
  this.handleLeaveRoomBeforeStaking(socket, roomCode);
});
```

### **2. New Handler Method**

```javascript
handleLeaveRoomBeforeStaking(socket, roomCode) {
  const room = this.roomManager.getRoom(roomCode);
  const isGuest = room.guest && room.guest.socketId === socket.id;

  // Only handle if this is a staked game and guest hasn't staked
  if (room.isStaked && isGuest && !room.guestStaked) {
    console.log('✅ Guest intentionally leaving - keeping room open');
    this.roomManager.removePlayerFromRoom(socket.id);
    
    // Notify host (optional)
    this.io.to(roomCode).emit('guestLeftBeforeStaking', { 
      message: 'Player left before staking. Room is still open.'
    });
    return;
  }

  // Handle as normal leave for other cases
  this.handleLeaveRoom(socket);
}
```

### **3. Updated Disconnect Handler**

The `handleDisconnect` method still has the fallback logic for when someone disconnects without emitting the leave event (network issues, etc.):

```javascript
if (room.isStaked && isGuest && !room.guestStaked) {
  console.log('🔄 Guest disconnected before staking - keeping room open');
  this.roomManager.removePlayerFromRoom(socket.id);
  this.io.to(roomCode).emit('guestLeftBeforeStaking');
  return; // Don't end game
}
```

## 📊 Event Flow

### **Before Fix:**
```
1. Player 2 clicks Cancel
2. navigate('/') called
3. Component unmounts
4. socket.disconnect() in cleanup
5. Backend: handleDisconnect()
6. ❌ Game ends, "opponent disconnected"
```

### **After Fix:**
```
1. Player 2 clicks Cancel
2. socket.emit('leaveRoomBeforeStaking')
3. Backend: handleLeaveRoomBeforeStaking()
4. ✅ Guest removed, room stays open
5. navigate('/') called
6. Component unmounts
7. socket.disconnect() in cleanup
8. Backend: handleDisconnect() finds no room (already removed)
9. ✅ No "opponent disconnected" alert
```

## 🎮 Scenarios Covered

### **Scenario 1: Intentional Cancel**
- Player 2 clicks "Cancel"
- `leaveRoomBeforeStaking` event sent
- Guest removed, room stays open
- No alerts to Player 1
- ✅ Works

### **Scenario 2: Network Disconnect**
- Player 2 loses connection
- No explicit leave event
- Backend detects disconnect
- `handleDisconnect` checks if guest has staked
- Guest hasn't staked → room stays open
- ✅ Works

### **Scenario 3: Close Tab/Browser**
- Player 2 closes browser
- Socket disconnects immediately
- Backend `handleDisconnect` runs
- Checks if guest has staked
- Guest hasn't staked → room stays open
- ✅ Works

### **Scenario 4: Staked Then Disconnect**
- Player 2 successfully stakes
- `guestStaked = true`
- Player 2 disconnects
- Backend checks `guestStaked = true`
- ❌ Game ends (correct behavior)
- ✅ Works

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Test Cancel Before Staking:**
   - Create staked game as Player 1
   - Join with Player 2
   - Click "Cancel" on staking modal
   - ✅ Player 1 should NOT see "opponent disconnected"
   - ✅ Room should still be open

2. **Test Error Then Cancel:**
   - Try to join own staked game
   - See error message
   - Click "Cancel"
   - ✅ Room should stay open

3. **Test Stake Then Disconnect:**
   - Player 2 joins and stakes
   - Player 2 closes browser
   - ✅ Player 1 should see "opponent disconnected"
   - ✅ Game should end

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Explicit Communication:** Frontend tells backend exactly what's happening
2. **Graceful Handling:** No false disconnect alerts
3. **Fallback Logic:** Still handles unexpected disconnects correctly
4. **Better UX:** Players can browse games without penalty
