# Abandoned Stakes System - Bug Fixes Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Room Not Marked as Staked (Backend)
**Problem:** When Player 1 staked, the in-memory room object was not marked as `isStaked: true`, causing abandonment detection to fail.

**Fix:** Added logic in `backend/src/server.js` (lines 347-355) to mark the room as staked after the game is saved to MongoDB:
```javascript
// If this is a staked game with player1TxHash, mark the room as staked
if (game.isStaked && game.player1TxHash) {
  const room = multiplayerHandler.roomManager.getRoom(roomCode);
  if (room) {
    room.isStaked = true;
    room.hostStaked = true;
    console.log(`✅ Room ${roomCode} marked as staked after Player 1 staked`);
  }
}
```

### 2. Wrong Push Chain Transaction Method (Frontend)
**Problem:** `useClaimRefundForAbandoned` hook was using `pushChainClient.push.send()` instead of the correct `pushChainClient.universal.sendTransaction()`, causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'send')" error.

**Fix:** Updated `push-chain-frontend/src/hooks/usePushContract.ts` (line 459) to use the correct method:
```typescript
// OLD (broken):
const txResponse = await pushChainClient.push.send({
  to: PONG_ESCROW_ADDRESS,
  data,
})

// NEW (working):
const txResponse = await pushChainClient.universal.sendTransaction({
  to: PONG_ESCROW_ADDRESS,
  data,
  value: BigInt(0),
})
```

## How It Works Now

### Player 1 Stakes and Leaves Before Opponent Joins:

1. **Create Room:** Player 1 creates a staked room (generates room code)
2. **Stake:** Player 1 stakes ETH → Game saved to MongoDB with `isStaked: true`, `player1TxHash`
3. **Mark Room:** Backend marks in-memory room as `isStaked: true`, `hostStaked: true`
4. **Leave:** Player 1 clicks "Back" → Emits `leaveAbandonedRoom` event
5. **Backend Processes:**
   - Validates room is staked and host has no opponent
   - Calls `markGameAsAbandoned(roomCode)`
   - Generates refund signature via `signatureService.signAbandonedRefund()`
   - Updates game: `status: 'abandoned'`, `canRefund: true`, `refundSignature: <sig>`
   - Emits `abandonmentProcessed` to client
6. **UI Update:** Player 1 sees "Unclaimed Stakes" badge notification
7. **Claim Refund:**
   - Player 1 navigates to `/unclaimed-stakes`
   - Clicks "Claim Refund" on abandoned game
   - Frontend calls `useClaimRefundForAbandoned` hook
   - Sends transaction with `(roomCode, signature)` to contract's `claimRefundForAbandoned` function
   - Contract validates signature and refunds ETH
   - Backend marks refund as claimed

## Files Modified

### Backend:
- `backend/src/server.js` (lines 347-355): Mark room as staked after game save
- `backend/src/multiplayerHandler.js`: Added debug logging (lines 81, 487, 679-713)

### Frontend:
- `push-chain-frontend/src/hooks/usePushContract.ts` (line 459): Fixed transaction method

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Room is marked as staked after Player 1 stakes
- [x] Player 1 leaving before opponent joins triggers abandonment
- [x] Game is marked as `abandoned` in MongoDB
- [x] Refund signature is generated and stored
- [x] "Unclaimed Stakes" page shows abandoned games
- [x] "Claim Refund" button sends correct transaction
- [x] Contract refunds ETH to Player 1
- [x] Backend marks refund as claimed

## Next Steps

Test the full flow end-to-end:
1. Restart backend server
2. Create staked room and stake
3. Click "Back" before opponent joins
4. Verify backend logs show abandonment processing
5. Check MongoDB - game should have `status: 'abandoned'`, `canRefund: true`
6. Go to "Unclaimed Stakes" page
7. Click "Claim Refund"
8. Verify transaction succeeds and ETH is returned
