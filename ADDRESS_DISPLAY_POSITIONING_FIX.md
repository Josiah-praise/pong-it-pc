# 📍 Address Display Positioning Fix

## Issue
The AddressDisplay component was using `position: fixed`, which positioned it relative to the viewport rather than the page content. This could cause issues with scrolling and consistency across pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated AddressDisplay.css
- Changed `position: fixed` → `position: absolute`
- Increased background opacity from `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)` → `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)` for better contrast
- This makes the component position relative to its parent container

### 2. Updated Parent Containers
Added `position: relative` to all page containers that use AddressDisplay:
- ✅ `.game-history-container` (GameHistory.css)
- ✅ `.my-wins-container` (MyWins.css)
- ✅ `.unclaimed-stakes-container` (already had it)

## Result
- The address display card (showing username, UEA, and Origin) now positions consistently at the top-right of each page
- Proper positioning relative to the page content border
- Scrolls naturally with page content
- Matches the design shown in the MyWins reference image

## Affected Pages
- Game History
- My Wins
- Unclaimed Stakes
- Multiplayer Game (during gameplay)
