# 🔧 Rematch Debug - Version 2

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `getRoomByUsername()` Helper
**File:** `backend/src/roomManager.js`

```javascript
getRoomByUsername(username) {
  // Search all rooms for a player with this username
  for (const room of this.rooms.values()) {
    if (room.host?.name === username || room.guest?.name === username) {
      return room;
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

**Why:** When players navigate to GameOver screen, they create **new sockets**, so looking up by socket.id fails. Username lookup is more reliable.

---

### 2. Enhanced `handleRematchRequest()` with Better Logging
**File:** `backend/src/multiplayerHandler.js`

Now logs:
- ✅ All tracked game-over players
- ✅ Total number of active rooms
- ✅ Details of every active room (code, host, guest, status, isStaked)
- ✅ Step-by-step opponent lookup process

---

### 3. Simplified Opponent Lookup Logic
```javascript
// OLD: Complex socket.id matching
const playerIndex = room.host.socketId === socket.id ? 0 : 1;
const opponent = playerIndex === 0 ? room.guest : room.host;

// NEW: Simple username matching
const opponent = room.host?.name === requesterUsername ? room.guest : room.host;
```

## What to Look For in Next Test

When you test again, the backend will log:

```
🔄 ========== REMATCH REQUEST ==========
👤 From: Poppy (socket: xxx)
📋 GameOver players tracked: [['Poppy', 'xxx'], ['Xing', 'yyy']]
🗂️  Total rooms active: X
📦 All active rooms:
   - ABC123: host=Poppy, guest=Xing, status=playing, isStaked=false
✅ Found room: ABC123 (host: Poppy, guest: Xing, isStaked: false)
🔍 Looking for opponent: Xing, tracked socket: yyy
✅ Sending rematch request from Poppy to Xing
=========================================
```

## Critical Question

**If you see `🗂️ Total rooms active: 0`**, it means the room is being destroyed despite our `preserveRoom` flag!

This would indicate one of:
1. `handleGameOver` is not being called (game ends via different path)
2. `preserveRoom` logic has a bug
3. Room is being cleaned up elsewhere

**Please share the FULL backend log** from:
- When the game ends
- Through the GameOver screen
- Until you click "Request Rematch"

Look specifically for the log:
```
🏠 Game over for room ABC123 - preserving room: true
```

If you DON'T see that log, the game is ending via a different code path!

## Next Steps

1. **Restart backend** to load changes
2. **Test rematch flow** again
3. **Copy the ENTIRE backend console output** and share it
4. This will tell us exactly where the room is disappearing
