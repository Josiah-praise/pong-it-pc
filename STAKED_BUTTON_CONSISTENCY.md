# ðŸ’Ž Staked Button Behavior Unified

## Change
- **Before**: Staked Match button was disabled (`disabled={!isWalletReady}`) and showed "Connect Wallet First" text
- **After**: Staked Match button is always enabled like other mode buttons, shows "Connect Wallet" dialog when clicked without a wallet

## Implementation
- Removed `disabled={!isWalletReady}` from the staked match button
- Removed conditional text display (`{isWalletReady ? 'Staked Match' : 'Connect Wallet First'}`)
- Now uses the existing `handleCreateStakedMatch` handler which already checks `isWalletReady` and calls `showAlert`

## Result
All four mode buttons now have consistent behavior:
1. Always appear clickable
2. Show friendly "Connect Wallet" dialog if wallet isn't connected
3. Proceed to their respective flows once wallet is connected
