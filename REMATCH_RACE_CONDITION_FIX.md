# 🏁 REMATCH - Race Condition Fix! ✅

## 🔍 The Real Problem

From the logs, the timing was:
```
Line 865: 🎮 GAME OVER starts
Line 922-934: Socket disconnects → checks game → DESTROYS ROOM ❌
Line 963: preserving room: true ← TOO LATE!
```

**Race Condition:** Old sockets were disconnecting **DURING** `handleGameOver` execution, BEFORE the game was removed from GameManager, so the check `if (!game)` didn't work!

---

## 🔧 The Real Fix

### Problem with Previous Approach:
```javascript
// ❌ DIDN'T WORK - game still exists during handleGameOver
const game = this.gameManager.getGame(roomCode);
if (!game) { /* keep room */ }
```

### New Approach - Room Status:
```javascript
// ✅ WORKS - mark room as finished IMMEDIATELY
if (room && shouldPreserveRoom) {
  room.status = 'finished';  // Set status FIRST
  console.log('🏠 marked as finished, preserving for rematch');
}
```

Then in disconnect handler:
```javascript
// ✅ Check room status instead of game existence
if (room.status === 'finished') {
  console.log('🎮 Game finished - keeping room for rematch');
  return; // Don't destroy!
}
```

## 📊 What Will Happen Now

### When Game Ends:
```
🎮 ========== GAME OVER ==========
🏠 Game over for room NBP78M - marked as finished, preserving for rematch
```

### When Old Socket Disconnects:
```
🔌 ========== DISCONNECT ==========
🏠 Room NBP78M: status=finished  ← KEY!
🎮 Game finished for room NBP78M - old socket disconnecting, keeping room for rematch
✅ Room preserved!
```

### When Rematch Requested:
```
🔄 ========== REMATCH REQUEST ==========
🗂️  Total rooms active: 1  ← FINALLY! 🎉
✅ Found room: NBP78M (status: finished)
✅ Sending rematch request to opponent
```

## 🎮 Key Changes

1. **Set `room.status = 'finished'` IMMEDIATELY** in `handleGameOver` BEFORE old sockets can disconnect
2. **Check room status** in disconnect handler instead of checking if game exists
3. **Race condition eliminated** - status is set synchronously, so disconnect handler will always see it

---

## 🧪 Test Now!

Backend should auto-restart. When you test:

1. **Game ends** → Room status set to 'finished'
2. **Sockets disconnect** → Sees 'finished' status → Keeps room
3. **Request rematch** → Room exists! → Dialogue appears! 🎊

**THIS SHOULD FINALLY WORK!** 🚀
