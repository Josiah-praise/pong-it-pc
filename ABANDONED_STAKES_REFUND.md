# ✅ Abandoned Stakes Refund System - Implementation Complete

## 📋 Overview

Successfully implemented a comprehensive refund system for abandoned staked games, allowing players to reclaim their stakes when they create a staked room but leave before anyone joins.

---

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Scenario:** Player 1 creates a staked game (e.g., stakes 0.01 PC), but no one joins before they leave. Previously, their stake would be locked in the contract with no way to retrieve it.

**Solution:** Hybrid approach combining backend authorization with smart contract validation for secure, immediate refunds.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

### **Smart Contract (Push Chain)**
- New function: `claimRefundForAbandoned(roomCode, signature)`
- Requires backend signature to prevent abuse
- Validates that no Player 2 has joined
- Emits `AbandonedMatchRefunded` event

### **Backend (Node.js + MongoDB)**
- Detects when host leaves empty staked room
- Generates cryptographic signature authorizing refund
- Stores refund eligibility in database
- Provides API to fetch abandoned stakes

### **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**
- New page: `/unclaimed-stakes`
- Badge notification showing count
- One-click refund claiming
- Real-time transaction status

---

## 📦 Implementation Details

### **1. Smart Contract Changes**

**File:** `hardhat-blockchain/contracts/PongEscrow.sol`

```solidity
function claimRefundForAbandoned(
    string calldata roomCode,
    bytes calldata signature
) external nonReentrant {
    // Validates:
    // - Match is in PLAYER1_STAKED state
    // - Caller is player1
    // - No player2 has joined
    // - Backend signature is valid
    
    // Refunds player1 immediately
}
```

**New Event:**
```solidity
event AbandonedMatchRefunded(
    string indexed roomCode,
    address indexed player,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 timestamp
);
```

---

### **2. Backend Changes**

#### **Signature Service**
**File:** `backend/src/services/signatureService.js`

```javascript
async signAbandonedRefund(roomCode, player1Address) {
    // Signs: keccak256(roomCode, player1Address, "ABANDONED")
    // Must match contract's signature verification
}
```

#### **MongoDB Schema**
**File:** `backend/src/models/Game.js`

```javascript
{
  canRefund: Boolean,           // Whether refund is available
  refundSignature: String,      // Backend-generated signature
  refundClaimed: Boolean,        // Whether refund was claimed
  refundTxHash: String,          // Transaction hash of refund
  refundClaimedAt: Date,         // When refund was claimed
  status: 'abandoned'            // New status type
}
```

#### **Multiplayer Handler**
**File:** `backend/src/multiplayerHandler.js`

```javascript
async handleDisconnect(socket) {
    // CASE 1: Host leaves staked room before anyone joins
    if (room.isStaked && isHost && !room.guest) {
        await this.markGameAsAbandoned(roomCode);
    }
}

async markGameAsAbandoned(roomCode) {
    // Generate signature
    // Update game status to 'abandoned'
    // Set canRefund = true
}
```

#### **API Endpoints**
**File:** `backend/src/server.js`

```javascript
// GET /games/abandoned-stakes/:address
// Returns list of unclaimed abandoned stakes for a player

// POST /games/:gameId/refund-claimed
// Marks refund as claimed after successful transaction
```

---

### **3. Frontend Changes**

#### **Contract Hook**
**File:** `push-chain-frontend/src/hooks/usePushContract.ts`

```typescript
export function useClaimRefundForAbandoned() {
    // Calls contract with roomCode and signature
    // Handles transaction lifecycle
    // Returns: { claimRefundForAbandoned, isPending, isSuccess, hash, error }
}
```

#### **Unclaimed Stakes Page**
**File:** `push-chain-frontend/src/components/UnclaimedStakes.tsx`

Features:
- 📊 Lists all abandoned stakes
- 💸 One-click refund claiming
- 🔄 Real-time transaction status
- ✅ Auto-refresh after successful claim
- 🎨 Matches game's color scheme (#DA76EC)

#### **Badge Notification**
**File:** `push-chain-frontend/src/components/Welcome.tsx`

```tsx
<button onClick={() => navigate('/unclaimed-stakes')} className="unclaimed-stakes-btn">
    💰 Unclaimed Stakes
    {unclaimedStakesCount > 0 && (
        <span className="badge">{unclaimedStakesCount}</span>
    )}
</button>
```

- Pulsing animation when count > 0
- Updates every 30 seconds
- Visible only when wallet is connected

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Backend Signature Required**
   - Contract validates signature from trusted oracle
   - Prevents unauthorized refunds

2. **Validation Checks**
   - Only player1 can claim
   - Only if status is PLAYER1_STAKED
   - Only if player2 never joined
   - One-time refund (no double-claims)

3. **Race Condition Safe**
   - Backend only signs if no player2TxHash exists
   - Contract checks player2 == address(0)

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### **Empty State**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✅ All Clear!                      │
│  You have no unclaimed stakes       │
│                                     │
│  Stakes appear here when you        │
│  create a staked game but leave     │
│  before anyone joins.               │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Unclaimed Stakes List**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  💰 Unclaimed Stakes                │
│  [2] Unclaimed Stakes               │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Room: ABC123          0.01 PC      │
│  📅 Oct 21, 2025 10:30 AM          │
│  🟧 Abandoned | No one joined       │
│  [💸 Claim Refund]                  │

│  📅 Oct 20, 2025 08:15 PM          │
│  🟧 Abandoned | No one joined       │
│  [💸 Claim Refund]                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### **Transaction Flow**
1. Click "Claim Refund"
2. Wallet prompts for signature
3. Transaction overlay appears
4. "View on Explorer" link provided
5. Auto-refreshes list on success

## 📊 Database Indexes

**Optimized Query Performance:**
```javascript
gameSchema.index({ 
    player1Address: 1, 
    canRefund: 1, 
    refundClaimed: 1 
});
```

**Query:** Find unclaimed stakes for an address
```javascript
{
    player1Address: address.toLowerCase(),
    status: 'abandoned',
    canRefund: true,
    refundClaimed: false
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### **Test 1: Normal Flow**
1. Player 1 creates staked game (0.01 PC)
2. Player 1 leaves before anyone joins
3. Backend detects abandonment
4. Backend generates signature
5. Game status set to 'abandoned'
6. Player 1 sees badge notification
7. Player 1 navigates to "Unclaimed Stakes"
8. Player 1 clicks "Claim Refund"
9. Transaction succeeds
10. Refund marked as claimed

### **Test 2: Race Condition**
1. Player 1 creates staked game
2. Player 2 joins simultaneously
3. Backend checks: player2TxHash exists
4. Backend does NOT generate signature
5. No abandoned refund available

### **Test 3: Security**
1. Player 1 creates staked game
2. Player 1 leaves (gets signature)
3. Player 2 joins later
4. Player 1 tries to claim refund
5. Contract rejects: player2 != address(0)

## 📈 Future Enhancements

1. **Time-based Expiry**
   - Optional: Add expiry date to signatures
   - E.g., must claim within 30 days

2. **Batch Refunds**
   - Allow claiming multiple refunds in one transaction
   - Gas optimization for users with many abandoned stakes

3. **Email Notifications**
   - Notify users when they have unclaimed stakes
   - Scheduled reminders

4. **Analytics Dashboard**
   - Track total abandoned stakes
   - Average time to claim
   - Abandonment rate by stake amount
