# Rematch System Implementation Complete! ✅

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### Option A: Disable Rematch for Staked Games

Successfully implemented the rematch flow differentiation between staked and unstaked games.

---

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. **Fixed Rematch Dialogue Not Showing (Unstaked Games)**

**Problem:** Opponent wasn't receiving rematch request dialogue.

**Solution:**
- Added `gameOverPlayers` Map to track players in game-over state
- Players emit `joinGameOverRoom` when entering GameOver screen
- Backend routes rematch requests to current socket IDs
- Fallback to old socket IDs for backwards compatibility

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/multiplayerHandler.js`: Added tracking system
- `frontend/src/components/GameOver.tsx`: Added `joinGameOverRoom` emission

---

### 2. **Staked Game Backend Changes**

**Added to `handleGameOver`:**
```javascript
// Check if game is staked
const room = this.roomManager.getRoom(roomCode);
const isStaked = room?.isStaked || false;

// Get stake amount from database
let stakeAmount = null;
if (isStaked) {
  const gameRecord = await Game.findOne({ roomCode });
  stakeAmount = gameRecord?.stakeAmount || null;
}

// Include in gameOverData
gameOverData = {
  ...gameOverData,
  isStaked,
  stakeAmount,
  roomCode
};
```

**Added to `handleRematchRequest`:**
```javascript
// Block rematch for staked games
if (room.isStaked) {
  socket.emit('error', { 
    message: 'Rematch not available for staked games. Please start a new match.' 
  });
  return;
}
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Backend Socket Events:
- `joinGameOverRoom` - Register player in game-over state
- `requestRematch` - Send rematch request (blocked for staked)
- `rematchRequested` - Notify opponent of rematch request
- `rematchResponse` - Accept or decline rematch

### Frontend State Management:
- `rematchRequested` - Show accept/decline modal
- `waitingForResponse` - Disable button while waiting
- `isStaked` - Determine which buttons to show
- `isWinner` - Show/hide claim prize button

### Data Flow:
1. Backend sends `gameOver` event with `isStaked`, `stakeAmount`, `roomCode`
2. Frontend receives and stores in location state
3. GameOver component reads state and renders appropriate UI
4. Rematch requests routed through `gameOverPlayers` Map
