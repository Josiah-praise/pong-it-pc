# üèì Pause Ball Stuck - Complete Fix

## Root Cause
The `handleResumeGame` method was **completely missing** from the backend, even though it was being called by the socket event handler. The auto-resume timeout in `handlePauseGame` was also not resetting the ball state, causing it to remain frozen.

## Fixes Applied

### Backend (`multiplayerHandler.js`)

1. **Added missing `handleResumeGame` method**:
   - Validates game state
   - Calls `gameManager.resumeGame()`
   - Resets ball with `gameManager.resetBall(game)`
   - Broadcasts `gameStateSnapshot` to all players
   - Emits `gameResumed` event

2. **Added missing `handleRequestGameState` method**:
   - Allows clients to request fresh game state
   - Sends `gameStateSnapshot` to the requesting socket

3. **Fixed auto-resume timeout in `handlePauseGame`**:
   - Now resets ball before resuming
   - Broadcasts `gameStateSnapshot` before `gameResumed`

### Frontend (`MultiplayerGame.tsx`)

1. **Removed redundant `requestGameState` call**:
   - Backend now proactively sends `gameStateSnapshot` before `gameResumed`
   - No need for client to request it again

2. **Already had `gameStateSnapshot` listener**:
   - Updates `gameData` and `prevGameDataRef` when received
   - Ensures UI updates with fresh ball position and velocity

## Result
‚úÖ Ball now resumes with proper velocity after pause (both manual and auto-resume)
‚úÖ Game state is synchronized across all clients
‚úÖ No more frozen ball after pause ends

## Testing
1. Start a multiplayer game
2. Hit pause (P key)
3. Wait for 10-second countdown OR manually resume
4. ‚úÖ Ball should immediately resume with velocity
