# üêõ Production Bugs Fixed - Abandoned Stakes

## Issue Summary

When testing abandoned stakes in production, two critical bugs were discovered:

1. ‚ùå Room not marked as `isStaked: true` in memory
2. ‚ùå Backend making HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8080` instead of using correct URL

---

## Bug #1: Room Not Marked as Staked

### Problem

**Database:**
```json
{
  "roomCode": "H5AQNW",
  "isStaked": true,  // ‚úÖ Correct
  "player1TxHash": "0xa64f06..."
}
```

**Backend Logs:**
```
üö™ handleLeaveAbandonedRoom - Room: H5AQNW {
  isStaked: false,  // ‚ùå WRONG!
  isHost: true,
  hasGuest: false
}
‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid abandonment attempt for room H5AQNW - guest exists or not staked
```

### Root Cause

**Timing Issue:**

1. Frontend calls `stakeAsPlayer1()` ‚Üí blockchain transaction
2. Frontend calls `POST /games` ‚Üí Creates DB record with `isStaked: true`
3. Backend tries to mark room as staked in memory ‚Üí **Room doesn't exist yet!**
4. Frontend navigates to `/game` ‚Üí Socket connects
5. Frontend emits `createRoom` ‚Üí **Room created with `isStaked: false`**
6. User clicks "Back" ‚Üí Room still shows `isStaked: false`

The room is created **AFTER** the `/games` POST, so the `isStaked` flag never gets set in memory.

### Solution

**Check database when creating room:**

```javascript
async handleCreateRoom(socket, player, providedRoomCode) {
  // ... create room logic ...
  
  if (providedRoomCode) {
    this.roomManager.createRoomWithCode(roomCode, player, socket.id);
    
    // NEW: Check if this is a staked game in the database
    const game = await Game.findOne({ roomCode: providedRoomCode });
    if (game && game.isStaked && game.player1TxHash) {
      const room = this.roomManager.getRoom(roomCode);
      if (room) {
        room.isStaked = true;
        room.hostStaked = true;
        console.log(`‚úÖ Room ${roomCode} marked as staked (found in database)`);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now when a room is created with a specific code (staked matches), it checks the database and marks it as staked immediately.

## Bug #2: Wrong API URL (localhost:8080)

### Problem

**Backend Logs:**
```
Error fetching player rating: FetchError: request to http://localhost:8080/players/qwerty failed, reason: ECONNREFUSED
```

The backend is trying to make HTTP requests to **itself** using `http://localhost:8080`, which doesn't exist in production.

### Root Cause

**In `backend/src/gameHandlers.js`:**

```javascript
this.playerServiceUrl = process.env.PLAYER_SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:8080';

// Later used in:
fetch(`${this.playerServiceUrl}/players/${encodeURIComponent(playerName)}`)
```

This is a **legacy API design** where the backend makes HTTP requests to itself. The environment variable `PLAYER_SERVICE_URL` is not set in production, so it defaults to `localhost:8080`.

### Why This Causes Problems

1. **Unnecessary network overhead** - The backend doesn't need to make HTTP requests to itself
2. **ECONNREFUSED errors** - `localhost:8080` doesn't resolve correctly in containerized environments
3. **Potential circular dependencies** - Could cause infinite loops if not careful

### Solution Options

#### Option 1: Set `PLAYER_SERVICE_URL` Environment Variable (Quick Fix)

Add to Render environment variables:
```
PLAYER_SERVICE_URL=https://pong-it-pc.onrender.com
```

**Pros:** Quick fix, no code changes  
**Cons:** Still makes unnecessary HTTP requests

#### Option 2: Refactor to Use Direct Database Access (Recommended)

The `gameHandlers.js` methods should call the database **directly** instead of making HTTP requests:

```javascript
// Instead of:
const response = await fetch(`${this.playerServiceUrl}/players/${playerName}`);

// Do this:
const player = await Player.findOne({ name: playerName });
```

This is more efficient and eliminates the network round-trip.

### Immediate Action

For now, **add the environment variable** to Render:

```
PLAYER_SERVICE_URL=https://pong-it-pc.onrender.com
```

Or just remove the `gameHandlers.js` dependency since `MultiplayerHandler` already uses the database directly via `leaderboardManager`.

## Files Modified

### Backend
- ‚úÖ `backend/src/multiplayerHandler.js`
  - Made `handleCreateRoom` async
  - Added database check to mark room as staked when created with a specific code
  - Enhanced logging in `handleLeaveAbandonedRoom`
  
- ‚úÖ `backend/src/server.js`
  - Added warning log when room not found when trying to mark as staked

---

## Environment Variables Needed in Production

Current variables (from user):
```
CHAIN_ID=42101
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xEb7f322B11CaeD433B194D916F01A0c41d3D3094
FRONTEND_URL=https://pong-it-pc.vercel.app/
KEEP_RENDER_ALIVE=false
MONGODB_URI="mongodb+srv://..."
PONG_ESCROW_ADDRESS=0xEb7f322B11CaeD433B194D916F01A0c41d3D3094
SIGNING_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xba5a54fa...
```

**ADD THIS:**
```
PLAYER_SERVICE_URL=https://pong-it-pc.onrender.com
```

Or remove the trailing slash from `FRONTEND_URL`:
```
FRONTEND_URL=https://pong-it-pc.vercel.app
```

## Testing Checklist

### Test Case 1: Fresh Staked Match
1. Deploy backend to Render
2. Clear all rooms from memory (restart backend)
3. Create new staked match
4. Click "Back" immediately
5. ‚úÖ Backend logs should show: `‚úÖ Room {code} marked as staked (found in database)`
6. ‚úÖ Game should be marked as `abandoned` in MongoDB
7. ‚úÖ "Unclaimed Stakes" should show the game

### Test Case 2: After Backend Restart
1. Create staked match
2. Wait for backend to restart (or restart manually)
3. Reconnect and click "Back"
4. ‚úÖ Should still work via database fallback in `handleLeaveAbandonedRoom`

### Test Case 3: Player Rating Fetch
1. Create any match
2. Check backend logs
3. ‚úÖ Should NOT see `ECONNREFUSED` errors
4. ‚úÖ Player rating should be fetched successfully

## Expected Logs After Fix

### When Creating Staked Match
```
New connection: { socketId: 'xyz', username: 'qwerty' }
Player qwerty connected with rating 1000
POST /games - Creating staked game { roomCode: 'H5AQNW', isStaked: true }
‚ö†Ô∏è Room H5AQNW not found in memory when trying to mark as staked - will be marked when room is created
Room created: H5AQNW by qwerty
‚úÖ Room H5AQNW marked as staked (found in database)
```

### When Leaving Staked Match
```
üîî Received leaveAbandonedRoom event - Socket: xyz, Room: H5AQNW
üîµ handleLeaveAbandonedRoom called
üö™ handleLeaveAbandonedRoom - Room: H5AQNW {
  isStaked: true,  // ‚úÖ NOW CORRECT!
  isHost: true,
  hasGuest: false
}
üí∞ Host intentionally leaving staked room H5AQNW before anyone joined - marking for refund
üü° Starting markGameAsAbandoned for room: H5AQNW
‚úÖ Game H5AQNW marked as abandoned - refund signature generated
```

## ‚úÖ Enhanced Logging Added

### What Was Added

**Heavy logging for the entire staked match flow:**

1. **`POST /games`** - When staked game is created
   - Request body details
   - Database save status
   - Room marking attempt

2. **`handleCreateRoom`** - When room is created
   - Room code and player details
   - Database lookup for staked status
   - Room marking confirmation

3. **`handleLeaveAbandonedRoom`** - When player leaves
   - Room validation
   - Eligibility checks
   - Success/failure reasons

4. **`markGameAsAbandoned`** - When marking as abandoned
   - Game details from database
   - Signature generation
   - Status update confirmation

### Log Format

All logs use clear section markers:
```
üèóÔ∏è  ========== CREATE ROOM ==========
... detailed logs ...
üèóÔ∏è  ========== CREATE ROOM END ==========
```

Each section includes:
- ‚è∞ Timestamps
- üîå Socket IDs
- üìä Data snapshots
- ‚úÖ Success indicators
- ‚ùå Error messages with reasons

### Documentation

See `STAKED_MATCH_LOGGING_GUIDE.md` for:
- Complete log flow examples
- Error scenario identification
- Debug checklists
- Success indicators
