# 🎯 REMATCH - Status Preservation Fix! ✅

## 🔍 The Final Bug

From the logs:
```
Line 425: roomStatus: 'finished'  ← 1st disconnect: Kept room ✅
Line 500: roomStatus: 'waiting'   ← 2nd disconnect: DESTROYED! ❌
```

**The Problem:** 
When the first old socket disconnects:
1. ✅ Sees `status = 'finished'` → Keeps room
2. ❌ Calls `removePlayerFromRoom()` 
3. ❌ `removePlayerFromRoom()` sets `room.status = 'waiting'`
4. ❌ Second socket disconnects → sees `status = 'waiting'` → DESTROYS ROOM!

## 🔧 The Fix

In `roomManager.js`, line 149:

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
if (room.guest && room.guest.socketId === socketId) {
  room.guest = null;
  room.status = 'waiting';  // ❌ Always resets status!
  this.playerRooms.delete(socketId);
  return room;
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
if (room.guest && room.guest.socketId === socketId) {
  room.guest = null;
  // Don't reset status if game is finished (preserving for rematch)
  if (room.status !== 'finished') {
    room.status = 'waiting';
  }
  this.playerRooms.delete(socketId);
  return room;
}
```

## 📊 What Will Happen Now

### First Socket Disconnects:
```
🔌 DISCONNECT
🏠 Room status: finished
🎮 Game finished - keeping room for rematch
✅ removePlayerFromRoom() → status STAYS 'finished'
```

### Second Socket Disconnects:
```
🔌 DISCONNECT
🏠 Room status: finished  ← STILL finished! ✅
🎮 Game finished - keeping room for rematch
✅ Room preserved!
```

### Rematch Request:
```
🔄 REMATCH REQUEST
🗂️  Total rooms active: 1  ← FINALLY! 🎉
✅ Found room!
✅ Sending rematch request!
📨 Opponent receives dialogue!
```

---

## 🎊 THIS IS IT!

The fix ensures that once a room is marked as 'finished':
- ✅ Status stays 'finished' even when players disconnect
- ✅ Room is preserved for both socket disconnections
- ✅ Rematch feature works!

**Test it now!** Backend should auto-restart. This should FINALLY work! 🚀🎮🎉
