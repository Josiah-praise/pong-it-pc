- [ ] Deploy contract to Push Chain Testnet
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Test wallet connection
- [ ] Test staking transactions
- [ ] Test prize claiming with UEA
- [ ] Update backend to store UEA addresses

---

## üîß Step 1: Environment Setup

### Create `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in `/push-chain-frontend/`:

```bash
# Backend URL
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Push Chain Contract Address (update after deployment)
VITE_PONG_ESCROW_ADDRESS=0x...

# Push Chain RPC URL (optional, default provided)
VITE_PUSH_RPC_URL=https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/
```

---

## üèóÔ∏è Step 2: Deploy Contract to Push Chain

### Update Hardhat Config

Edit `/hardhat-blockchain/hardhat.config.ts`:

```typescript
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.24",
  networks: {
    // ... existing networks ...
    
    push_testnet: {
      url: 'https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/',
      chainId: 42101,
      accounts: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : []
    }
  }
};

export default config;
```

### Create `.env` in Hardhat Directory

```bash
cd hardhat-blockchain
nano .env
```

Add your private key:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

### Deploy Contract

```bash
cd hardhat-blockchain
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network push_testnet
```

**Expected Output:**
```
PongEscrow deployed to: 0xABCDEF...
```

### Update Frontend `.env`

Copy the deployed contract address to `/push-chain-frontend/.env`:

```
VITE_PONG_ESCROW_ADDRESS=0xABCDEF...
```

## üí∞ Step 3: Get Test Tokens

### Visit Push Chain Faucet

1. Go to https://faucet.push.org/
2. Connect your wallet (MetaMask or any EVM wallet)
3. Switch network to Push Chain Testnet (Chain ID: 42101)
4. Request PC tokens for gas fees

**Network Details:**
- **Network Name:** Push Chain Testnet
- **RPC URL:** https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/
- **Chain ID:** 42101
- **Currency Symbol:** PC
- **Block Explorer:** https://donut.push.network

---

## üîÑ Step 4: Backend Updates (CRITICAL!)

### Update Backend to Store UEA Addresses

The backend needs to store **both** origin addresses and UEA addresses because:
- The **origin address** is what the user sees in their wallet
- The **UEA** is what the contract stores as `msg.sender`

#### Modify Game Model

In `/backend/src/models/Game.js`:

```javascript
const gameSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  roomCode: String,
  
  // Player 1
  player1Address: String,      // Origin address (for display)
  player1UEA: String,           // Universal Executor Account (for contract queries)
  player1TxHash: String,
  
  // Player 2
  player2Address: String,       // Origin address (for display)
  player2UEA: String,           // Universal Executor Account (for contract queries)
  player2TxHash: String,
  
  // Winner
  winnerAddress: String,        // Origin address (for display)
  winnerUEA: String,            // Universal Executor Account (for filtering wins)
  
  // ... rest of schema
});
```

#### Update API Endpoints

##### POST `/games` - Create/Update Game

Frontend now sends both addresses:
```javascript
{
  roomCode: "ABC123",
  player1Address: "eip155:42101:0xUSER...",  // Origin
  player1UEA: "0xUEA...",                     // Universal Executor Account
  player1TxHash: "0x...",
  stakeAmount: "0.01",
  // ...
}
```

Backend should store both.

##### GET `/games/my-wins?address=0xUEA...` - Get User Wins

**CRITICAL CHANGE:** This endpoint now receives the **UEA address**, not the origin address!

```javascript
app.get('/games/my-wins', async (req, res) => {
  const { address, limit, offset } = req.query;
  
  // Filter by UEA, not origin address!
  const wins = await Game.find({
    winnerUEA: address.toLowerCase(),  // Use UEA for filtering
    isStaked: true,
    status: 'completed'
  })
  .limit(parseInt(limit))
  .skip(parseInt(offset))
  .sort({ endedAt: -1 });
  
  res.json({ games: wins, pagination: { ... } });
});
```

#### Update Signature Service

In `/backend/src/services/signatureService.js`:

When game ends, generate signature for the **UEA address**, not origin:

```javascript
async function generateWinnerSignature(roomCode, winnerSocketId, gameState) {
  const game = await Game.findOne({ roomCode });
  
  // Determine winner's UEA address
  let winnerUEA;
  if (winnerSocketId === game.player1SocketId) {
    winnerUEA = game.player1UEA;
  } else {
    winnerUEA = game.player2UEA;
  }
  
  // Sign with UEA, not origin address
  const messageHash = ethers.solidityPackedKeccak256(
    ['string', 'address'],
    [roomCode, winnerUEA]  // Use UEA!
  );
  
  const signature = await wallet.signMessage(ethers.getBytes(messageHash));
  
  // Store winner's UEA for filtering
  await Game.findOneAndUpdate(
    { roomCode },
    {
      winnerUEA: winnerUEA,
      winnerSignature: signature,
      status: 'completed'
    }
  );
  
  return signature;
}
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 5: Run the Application

### Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

**Expected:** Server running on `http://localhost:8080`

### Start Frontend

```bash
cd push-chain-frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected:** Dev server running on `http://localhost:5173`

---

## üß™ Step 6: Testing Workflow

### Test 1: Wallet Connection

1. Open `http://localhost:5173`
2. Click "Connect Wallet" (Push Chain UI Kit button)
3. Connect with Email, Google, or MetaMask
4. Verify wallet address shows in top right

**Expected:** Wallet connects successfully, address displays as CAIP-10 format

### Test 2: Create Staked Match (Player 1)

1. Enter username (e.g., "Alice")
2. Click "Staked Match" button
3. Select stake amount (e.g., 0.01 PC)
4. Confirm transaction in wallet
5. Wait for blockchain confirmation

**Expected:** 
- Transaction modal shows "Confirm in Wallet" ‚Üí "Confirming" ‚Üí Success
- Navigate to game screen
- Room code displayed
- "Waiting for opponent..." message

**Check Backend Logs:**
```
‚úÖ Staked game created: {
  roomCode: "ABC123",
  player1Address: "eip155:42101:0xUSER...",
  player1UEA: "0xUEA...",
  stakeAmount: "0.01",
  ...
}
```

### Test 3: Join Staked Match (Player 2)

**Open Second Browser/Incognito:**

1. Go to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Connect different wallet
3. Enter username (e.g., "Bob")
4. Click "Join Room"
5. Enter room code from Player 1 (e.g., "ABC123")
6. Modal appears: "üíé Staked Match - Stake 0.01 PC to join"
7. Click "Stake & Play"
8. Confirm transaction
9. Wait for confirmation

**Expected:**
- Player2 staking modal ‚Üí transaction ‚Üí success
- Both players' games start
- Pong game begins

**Check Backend:**
```
‚úÖ Player2 staked: {
  roomCode: "ABC123",
  player2Address: "eip155:42101:0xUSER2...",
  player2UEA: "0xUEA2...",
  player2TxHash: "0x...",
  status: "ready"
}
```

### Test 4: Complete Game and Check Winner

1. Play the game (first to 5 points wins)
2. When game ends:
   - Winner gets "You Won!" message
   - Loser gets "You Lost!" message
   - Both see final score

**Check Backend Signature Generation:**
```
üéÅ Generating signature for winner...
Winner UEA: 0xUEA...
Signature: 0x...
‚úÖ Game marked as completed
```

### Test 5: Claim Prize (CRITICAL UEA TEST!)

**As Winner:**

1. Click "Back to Home"
2. Click "üèÜ My Wins" button
3. Page should show:
   - Your wallet address (origin)
   - Your UEA address
   - List of wins filtered by UEA

4. Find the win you just got
5. Click "Claim Prize"
6. Confirm transaction
7. Wait for confirmation

**Expected:**
- Transaction succeeds
- Prize transferred to your wallet
- Win marked as "‚úÖ Claimed"
- Transaction hash shown with link to explorer

**Frontend Console Logs to Check:**
```
üîç Fetching wins for UEA: 0xUEA...
üìù Origin address: eip155:42101:0xUSER...
‚úÖ Fetched wins: [...]
üéÅ Claiming prize for room: ABC123
‚úÖ Prize claimed successfully!
```

**Verify on Blockchain:**
1. Click transaction hash link
2. Should open Push Chain explorer: https://donut.push.network/tx/0x...
3. Verify transaction succeeded
4. Check balance increased by stake amount

---

## üîç Debugging Common Issues

### Issue 1: "No wins found" even after winning

**Cause:** Backend is filtering by origin address instead of UEA

**Fix:** Update backend `/games/my-wins` endpoint to use `winnerUEA` field

### Issue 2: Prize claim fails with "InvalidSignature"

**Cause:** Signature was generated for origin address instead of UEA

**Fix:** Update `generateWinnerSignature()` to sign with UEA address

### Issue 3: Transaction fails with "Insufficient funds"

**Cause:** No PC tokens in wallet

**Fix:** Get more tokens from https://faucet.push.org/

### Issue 4: "Universal Executor Account not found"

**Cause:** `useExecutorAddress` hook failing

**Fix:** Check Push Chain SDK version and wallet connection

### Issue 5: Wallet connects but transactions fail

**Cause:** Wrong network or RPC issues

**Fix:** 
- Verify network is Push Chain Testnet (42101)
- Check RPC URL: https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/
- Try reconnecting wallet

---

## üìä Monitoring & Verification

### Frontend Console Checks

**Good logs to see:**
```
‚úÖ All conditions met! Staking successful!
üîç Fetching wins for UEA: 0xUEA...
üéÅ Claiming prize for room: ABC123
‚úÖ Prize claimed successfully!
```

### Backend Console Checks

**Good logs to see:**
```
‚úÖ Staked game created in database
‚úÖ Game record updated with Player2 stake
üéÅ Generating signature for winner...
‚úÖ Game marked as completed
```

### Contract Verification

Use Push Chain explorer to verify:
- Deployment address matches `.env`
- Staking transactions succeed
- Claim transactions succeed
- Token transfers work

---

## üéØ Success Criteria

Before considering deployment complete, verify:

- [x] Contract deployed to Push Chain Testnet
- [x] Frontend connects to Push Chain
- [x] Player1 can create staked match
- [x] Player2 can join and stake
- [x] Game plays normally
- [x] Winner gets signature
- [x] "My Wins" page shows wins (filtered by UEA!)
- [x] Prize claiming works
- [x] Tokens transfer correctly
- [x] No console errors
- [x] Transactions appear in explorer

---

## üö® Critical Points to Remember

### 1. **UEA vs Origin Address**
```
User's Wallet Address (Origin): eip155:42101:0xUSER...
Universal Executor Account (UEA): 0xUEA...

Contract sees: UEA
User sees: Origin
Backend stores: BOTH
```

### 2. **Where to Use UEA**
- Filtering wins in "My Wins" page ‚úÖ
- Generating winner signature ‚úÖ
- Any contract address comparisons ‚úÖ

### 3. **Where to Use Origin**
- Displaying to user ‚úÖ
- Socket.IO communication ‚úÖ
- Username associations ‚úÖ
