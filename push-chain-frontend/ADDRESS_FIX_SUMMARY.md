# Address Storage Fix Summary

## 🐛 Problem

Player addresses (`player1Address` and `player2Address`) were not being saved to the MongoDB database.

### Root Cause

The frontend was attempting to send `address` from `universalAccount?.caipAddress`, but:
1. **TypeScript Error**: `caipAddress` property doesn't exist on `UniversalAccount` type
2. **Wrong Approach**: We were trying to extract the address manually from CAIP format

## ✅ Solution

### Changed From (Broken):
```typescript
const { universalAccount } = usePushWalletContext();
const address = universalAccount?.caipAddress?.split(':')[2];  // ❌ Wrong!
```

### Changed To (Working):
```typescript
const { pushChainClient } = usePushChainClient();
const address = pushChainClient?.universal?.account?.toLowerCase() || null;  // ✅ Correct!
```

## 📝 Files Updated

1. **`/push-chain-frontend/src/components/Welcome.tsx`** (Line 43-49)
   - Fixed Player 1 address retrieval
   - Address now sent correctly to backend when staking

2. **`/push-chain-frontend/src/components/MultiplayerGame.tsx`** (Line 77-83)
   - Fixed Player 2 address retrieval
   - Address now sent correctly when Player 2 stakes

3. **`/push-chain-frontend/src/components/MyWins.tsx`** (Line 34-40)
   - Fixed address retrieval for filtering wins
   - Used for display purposes (not UEA comparisons)

## 🔍 How It Works Now

### When Player 1 Creates Staked Game:
```typescript
// Welcome.tsx - Line 163-174
fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/games`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    roomCode: pendingRoomCode,
    player1: { name: savedUsername, rating: 800 },
    isStaked: true,
    stakeAmount: selectedStakeAmount,
    player1Address: address,  // ✅ Now correctly sends "0xABC..."
    player1TxHash: stakingTxHash,
    status: 'waiting'
  })
})
```

### When Player 2 Joins:
```typescript
// MultiplayerGame.tsx - Line 547-556
fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/games`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    roomCode: stakingData.roomCode,
    player2: { name: username, rating: 800 },
    player2Address: address,  // ✅ Now correctly sends "0xDEF..."
    player2TxHash: player2TxHash,
    status: 'playing'
  })
})
```

## 🧪 Testing

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Create a staked game** as Player 1
2. **Check database** for the game document
3. **Verify** `player1Address` field is populated with `0x...` format
4. **Join game** as Player 2
5. **Check database** again
6. **Verify** `player2Address` field is now populated

### Expected Database Document:
```json
{
  "roomCode": "ABC123",
  "player1Address": "0xa5526df9eb2016d3624b4dc36a91608797b5b6d5",  // ✅ Present
  "player2Address": "0x9ad6b669eb355d4924eca26ddf0636f4897aef22",  // ✅ Present
  "player1TxHash": "0x290989...",
  "player2TxHash": "0x4e25c1...",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## 📚 Technical Details

### Push Chain Address Hierarchy:

1. **Universal Account** - Complex object managed by Push Chain SDK
2. **Push Chain Client** - Provides `universal.account` which is the Ethereum address
3. **UEA (Universal Executor Account)** - Derived from the account, used by contracts

### Correct Access Pattern:

```typescript
import { usePushWalletContext, usePushChainClient } from '@pushchain/ui-kit';

// Get connection status
const { connectionStatus } = usePushWalletContext();

// Get user's Ethereum address (for display and backend storage)
const { pushChainClient } = usePushChainClient();
const address = pushChainClient?.universal?.account?.toLowerCase();

// Get UEA (for contract comparisons)
const { executorAddress } = useExecutorAddress();
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

1. ✅ Use `usePushChainClient()` to get user's Ethereum address
2. ✅ Use `pushChainClient.universal.account` for the address
3. ✅ Always lowercase the address for consistency
4. ✅ Store this address in the backend database
5. ✅ Use `useExecutorAddress()` hook for contract-related comparisons
