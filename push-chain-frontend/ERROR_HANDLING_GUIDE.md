# Error Handling Guide

## ✅ Improved Error Handling Implementation

We've implemented a centralized error parsing system that provides **user-friendly error messages** instead of raw blockchain errors.

---

## 📝 What Was Changed

### 1. **Created Error Parser Utility** (`src/utils/errorParser.ts`)

A centralized utility that translates blockchain/contract errors into clear, actionable messages for users.

#### Features:
- ✅ **User-friendly titles and messages**
- ✅ **Actionable vs non-actionable error detection**
- ✅ **Retry guidance** (tells users if they can retry)
- ✅ **Comprehensive error coverage**

---

## 🎯 Supported Error Types

### **User Action Errors** (Can Retry):
1. **Transaction Cancelled**
   - User rejected the transaction in wallet
   - Message: "You cancelled the transaction. Click 'Retry' when you're ready to proceed."

2. **Insufficient Funds**
   - Not enough PC tokens in wallet
   - Message: "You don't have enough PC tokens to complete this transaction. Please add funds and try again."

3. **Network Error**
   - Connection issues with blockchain
   - Message: "Unable to connect to the blockchain. Please check your internet connection and try again."

4. **Transaction Timeout**
   - Transaction took too long
   - Message: "The transaction took too long to process. Please try again."

5. **Gas Estimation Failed**
   - Not enough gas or transaction would fail
   - Message: "The transaction requires more gas than available. Please check your wallet balance."

6. **Transaction Order Issue (Nonce)**
   - Problem with transaction sequencing
   - Message: "There was a problem with the transaction order. Please refresh the page and try again."

### **Game/Contract Errors** (Cannot Retry):
1. **Cannot Join Own Game**
   - Trying to join a game you created
   - Message: "You cannot join a game that you created. Please create a new game or join a different one."

2. **Game Not Found**
   - Room code doesn't exist
   - Message: "This game room does not exist or has already started. Please check the room code."

3. **Game Already Full**
   - Room already has 2 players
   - Message: "This game already has two players. Please join a different game or create your own."

4. **Incorrect Stake Amount**
   - Stake amount doesn't match requirements
   - Message: "The stake amount doesn't match the game requirements. Please check the required amount."

5. **Game Already Started**
   - Cannot join a game in progress
   - Message: "This game has already begun. You cannot join a game in progress."

6. **Already Claimed**
   - Prize was already claimed
   - Message: "This prize has already been claimed. Please refresh the page to see updated prizes."

7. **Execution Reverted**
   - Smart contract rejected the transaction
   - Message: Custom error from contract OR "The transaction was rejected by the smart contract."

## 💡 Usage Example

### Before:
```typescript
// Raw error display
if (error) {
  alert(error.message); // Shows: "execution reverted: Cannot join own match. Estimate Gas Arguments: from: 0xa552..."
}
```

### After:
```typescript
import { parseTransactionError } from '../utils/errorParser';

if (error) {
  const parsed = parseTransactionError(error);
  // Shows: "You cannot join a game that you created. Please create a new game or join a different one."
  alert(parsed.message);
}
```

## 🎨 Error Display

### Error Modal Structure:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ❌ [Error Title]                   │
│                                     │
│  [Clear, user-friendly message]     │
│                                     │
│  [Retry Button]  [Cancel Button]    │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Example for "Cannot Join Own Game":
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ❌ Cannot Join Own Game            │
│                                     │
│  You cannot join a game that you    │
│  created. Please create a new game  │
│  or join a different one.           │
│                                     │
│         [Back to Home]              │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```
