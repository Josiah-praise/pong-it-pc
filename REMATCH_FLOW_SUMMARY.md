# âœ… Rematch Logic Summary

## Current Flow
1. After the game ends, `handleGameOver()` sets `room.status = 'finished'` and calls `endGame(roomCode, true)` (preserve room). This stops the game loop, removes the game from GameManager, but keeps the room in RoomManager so rematches can run.
2. When game-over sockets connect, `joinGameOverRoom` re-attaches their new sockets to the preserved room (so rematch start/decline events know where to go).
3. Rematch request succeeds and the new game starts in the same room.

## QuickMatch & Disconnect Fixes
- `startGame` now allows rooms in `'ready'` or `'finished'` to transition to `'playing'`, covering both quick-match and rematch paths.
- `handleDisconnect` recognises `room.status === 'finished' || !activeGame` as a post-game scenario and keeps the room for rematch, instead of clearing it like an active-game disconnect.

Everything aligns, and rematch is back to working order! ðŸŽ‰
